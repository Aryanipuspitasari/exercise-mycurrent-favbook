        <small>Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness</small>

        <p>
          Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money
          isn&apos;t necessarily about what you know. It&apos;s about how you
          behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.
          How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are
          typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations,
          where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real
          world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They
          make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal
          history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd
          incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the
          author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think
          about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of
          life&apos;s most important matters.
